📥 STEP 1: Ingestion Agent
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2026-02-16 19:17:25,053 - root - INFO - 🤖 Ingestion Agent: Processing day3_schema_change.csv with Gemini reasoning...
2026-02-16 19:17:35,012 - root - INFO - 🧠 Gemini detected schema change: Here's an analysis of the schema change:

1.  **Has the schema changed?**
    Yes, the schema has changed.

2.  **What are the new columns (if any)?**
    The new column is `region`.

3.  **What are the implications for downstream processing?**
    *   **Data Models & ETL/ELT:** All downstream data models, ETL/ELT jobs, and data pipelines will need to be updated to account for the new `region` column. This includes staging tables, data warehouses, and data lakes.
    *   **Applications & APIs:** Applications, APIs, and microservices consuming this data will need to be reviewed. If they use `SELECT *` or have strict schema expectations, they might break. Consumers should be adapted to either ignore the new column or incorporate it as needed.
    *   **Reporting & Analytics:** Reports, dashboards, and analytical queries might need to be updated to include or exclude the `region` column, and potentially develop new insights based on this data.
    *   **Storage & Performance:** A slight increase in storage requirements, though negligible for `(10, 6)` data shape. Performance impact is usually minimal for column additions unless it affects indexing strategies.

4.  **Should we be concerned about any changes?**
    Yes, a schema addition, while generally backward-compatible (consumers can often ignore new fields), requires attention.
    *   **Risk of Failure:** Downstream systems that are not resilient to schema evolution (e.g., rigid parsing, `SELECT *` in production code) are at risk of failure.
    *   **Data Quality:** Ensure the `region` column is populated correctly and consistently from the source. Validate its data type and values.
    *   **Communication:** Proactive communication with all data consumers is crucial to prevent unexpected outages or incorrect data processing.

**Actionable Response:**

*   **Immediately assess and update all affected downstream systems:** Prioritize critical data pipelines, applications, and reports to incorporate or gracefully handle the new `region` column.
*   **Communicate the change:** Inform all stakeholders and data consumers about the new column, its intended use, and its data type.
*   **Validate Data Quality:** Ensure the `region` data is accurate, complete, and conforms to expected formats (e.g., geographical regions, consistent naming).
*   **Document the change:** Update schema documentation, data dictionaries, and any relevant data governance policies.
